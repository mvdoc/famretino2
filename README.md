# Analysis scripts and data for "THE TITLE"

This repository contains the analysis scripts and raw data for "The
Title", by Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello, Morgan Taylor, Patrick
Cavanagh, and M.  Ida Gobbini. A preprint is available at XXX.

All the analysis are provided as RMarkdown notebooks; a converted HTML
version is already present in the directory that can be inspected using
a regular browser.

This repository uses [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) to
track dependencies. If you open RStudio to the top directory of this
project, and restart R ('Session' --> 'Restart R' in Rstudio), packrat
should automatically start downloading the required packages from CRAN.

For a description of the columns of the raw data, please refer to the
README.md files in the `data` directories.
