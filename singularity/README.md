Here we provide a Singularity definition file and a script to generate
the Singularity file using Neurodocker. The image is used to run the
simulations. Using the most recent versions of singularity (>= 2.4), the
image can be built with root privileges with

```terminal
singularity build neuropy36.img Singularity
```
